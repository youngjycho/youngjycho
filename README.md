- ðŸ™‰ Hi, Iâ€™m @youngjycho but you can call me Joe!
- ðŸŽ­ Iâ€™m interested in medical physics and biomedical engineering as a recent biophysics graduate from Wake Forest University. I'm also interested in creative writing and music, so feel free to recommend me any good books or songs!
- ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently taking Harvard's CS50's Intro to Comp Sci, so I can get a better handle in the world of computer science. 
- ðŸ¤” Not currently working on any projects, but when the time comes it'll be revolutionary (lol maybe)!
- ðŸ’Œ If you ever want to connect with me, the best place to find me is my LinkedIn page: www.linkedin.com/in/youngjycho .
- ðŸŽ¢ Other than that, maybe keep an eye out for my own custom-made website??? (note-to-self, new project idea: a website) Cheers!
